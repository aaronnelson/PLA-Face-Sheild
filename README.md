# PLA-Face-Shield
Parts and Instructions for PLA Face Shield.  Files will be updated as revisions become available.

1.  Print the two parts Mask and Band
2.  Assemble mask and band by attaching two rubber bands to the hooks on both parts
3.  Hole punch 8.5 x 11 in transparancy using the spacing indicated on the template.

####PRINT SETTINGS####

We are printing these on MakerBot Replicator 2 in PLA with the following settings:
  
  240 C at extruder
  
  0.3mm layer height
  
  0 % infill
  
  4 top and bottom layers
  
  3 shells
  
  0.40 extrusion width
  
  5500 mm/min print speed
  
  Outline underspeed at 90%
  
  First Layer at 90 % height, 125% width, and 70% speed
  
  Internal and External Thin Walls as Perimeters Only
  
  This results in a 35 minute print on our machines.  I have also modified the starting G CODE to reduce the length of the purge.
  
  #### ASSEMBLY ####
  
  We remove the prints with gloves as not to pass along any viral material and place them into ziploc bags.
  
  Transparancies should be for laser printers and copiers, the thermal or inkjet types have a "tooth" that makes them hazy
  We are going to attempt to replace the transparancies with 0.005 polycarb sheet as a stiffer and clearer alternative.
  
  3.5 in Rubber bands seem to wokr the best for the headbands.
